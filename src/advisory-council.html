            <p class="h4  team-page__intro">The Advisory Council plays a pivotal role as an external and high-level expert body, offering strategic guidance, support, and recommendations to the Project Management and Project Lead. Comprising esteemed members from various sectors, the Advisory Council's key objective is to assist in achieving project goals and evaluating project milestones. These members, selected for a tenure of two years by Project Management, contribute their wealth of expertise and experience from government, academia, civil society, and the corporate sector. Mid-term reviews, scheduled for June 2025 in Kyiv, ensure continuous alignment with the project's trajectory.</p>
            <p class="h4  team-page__intro">Functioning as a non-voting entity, the Advisory Council focuses on strategic guidance rather than decision-making related to project management. The Council is composed of up to fifteen distinguished representatives from Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and internationally. Twice-yearly Advisory Council Meetings occur, featuring both physical and virtual sessions. The Chairperson, elected during the inaugural meeting, leads the sessions, crafts the Council's written reports, and presents them to the Project Management. Semiannual reports by one of the Project Leads keep the Advisory Council informed about project advancements.</p>
            <p class="h4  team-page__intro">The Advisory Council of the GDU project boasts an assembly of up to 20 eminent individuals, chosen to reflect diverse sectors and countries, particularly Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and the EU. Appointed for a comprehensive four-year term, lasting until the culmination of May 2027, the Council convenes annually to provide insightful direction to the Project Coordination Group. In addition to assessing GDU's progression according to the Roadmap, they meticulously consider the project's broader context. Upholding the code of conduct is of utmost importance, and in their first meeting, the Council elects a Chair and, if necessary, up to two Vice-Chairs</p>
