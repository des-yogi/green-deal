                <p>This program aims to empower city energy and climate advisors or to shape this role in the case that it does not exist through online live lectures by EU and Ukrainian experts as well as intensive individual and peer learning sessions. Participants will be tasked with developing and submitting a practical case paper or an energy plan for their local community under the supervision of convenors and experts. By the end of the program, participants will gain a robust network of energy experts through an active alumni network, supported by practical tools and engaging in-person events.</p>
